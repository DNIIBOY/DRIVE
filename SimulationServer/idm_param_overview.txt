IDM Model Parameters:

    v: Current Speed
        Role: The car's current speed in the simulation.
        Unit: Decimeters per second (dm/s) or meters per second (m/s).

    v0: Desired Speed
        Role: The maximum speed the driver aims to maintain in free-flow traffic.
        Unit: dm/s
        Effect: Determines how aggressively the car accelerates when the road ahead is clear.

    amax: Maximum Acceleration
        Role: The maximum acceleration the car can achieve under ideal conditions.
        Unit: dm/s^2 or m/s^2.
        Effect: Controls how quickly the car accelerates to reach v0.

    b: Comfortable Deceleration
        Role: Represents the maximum deceleration rate the driver is comfortable applying.
        Unit: dm/s^2 or m/s^2.
        Effect: Higher b enables more aggressive braking, while lower b results in smoother braking.

    s0: Minimum Safe Distance
        Role: The minimum gap maintained between cars when stopped or moving at very low speeds.
        Unit: Distance, typically in dm or m.
        Effect: Prevents cars from coming too close even at a standstill.

    T: Time Headway
        Role: The desired time gap between the car and the one ahead.
        Unit: Seconds (s).
        Effect: Larger T leads to more cautious driving with greater following distances. Smaller T results in closer following distances.
